# Inverse design of Metamaterial structures
Metamaterials with functional responses are materials that have been created to display varied behaviors or qualities depending on the situation. Metamaterials owe their uniqueness to their material structure rather than their chemical composition.

This work addresses the challenging problem of inverse design for metamaterial microstructures, where the goal is to derive structural designs that meet specific target properties. The complexity of this task stems from the infinite-dimensional design space and the one-to-many relationship between structures and their properties. Traditional methods, such as topology optimization (TO), although powerful, are often sensitive to initial conditions and prone to converging on local minima, limiting their ability to explore the diverse range of geometries that could achieve the same properties. Additionally, these methods tend to be computationally intensive, making them less suitable for rapid prototyping and real-time applications.

This brings us to the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to design structure geometries of metamaterial to meet desired property requirements (in this case a ratio of stiffness $\alpha$)
